`border` attribute's writing format is `border: border-width border-style border-color`. These three value has no order. However, `border-style` is the essential valueã€‚`border-width`'s default width is `medium`, which is about 3 or 4 pixel.

`border-style` is one of the following value: `none, hidden, dotted, dashed, solid, double, groove, ridge, inset, outset, inherit`.

In my point of view, `border-style` except `solid` always has no use.
